Example: Implementing a new NETCONF RPC operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows how to implement a simple NETCONF RPC operation in
an executable using three different techniques; an executable that
parses the XML, an executable that gets parsed data on the command line,
and a C-callback function.

The RPC we want to implement will look like this:

  <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
    <math xmlns="http://example.com/math">
      <add>
         <operand>2</operand>
         <operand>3</operand>
      </add>
    </math>
  </rpc>

and a reply:

  <rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1">
    <result xmlns="http://example.com/math">5</result>
  </rpc-reply>

The new RPC operations are specified in math-rpc.yang.

The code which reads XML is implemented in math.c, which is compiled into
the executable math.

The code which gets parsed XML is implemented in the shell script math2.

The code which has the callback is implemented in math-capi.c.


Starting the Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 1. Build the necessary files and start ConfD by typing 

        $ make all start

 2. To send the sample query defined in cmd-math.xml, type

        $ make query

 3. To send the sample query defined in cmd-math2.xml, type

        $ make query2

 4. To send the sample query defined in cmd-math3.xml, type

        $ make query3
