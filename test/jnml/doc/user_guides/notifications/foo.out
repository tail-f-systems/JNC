    <title>Notifications</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        NETCONF notifications are defined in the IETF draft: 
      </p>
      <p>
	<em>
	  "NETCONF Event Notifications" -
          "draft-ietf-netconf-notification-11.txt" </em>
      </p>
      <p>
	A NETCONF client indicates interest in receiving event 
	notifications from a NETCONF server by creating a subscription
	to receive event notifications. The NETCONF server replies to 
	indicate whether the subscription request was successful and, 
	if it was successful, begins sending the event notifications 
	to the NETCONF client as the events occur within the system.  
	These event notifications will continue to be sent until
	either the NETCONF session is terminated or the subscription
	terminates for some other reason.  The event notification
	subscription allows a number of options to enable the NETCONF client
	to specify which events are of interest.  These are specified when
	the subscription is created.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NETCONF notification draft also defines a repaly
        mechanism. Replay is the ability to create an event
        subscription that will resend recently generated
        notifications, or in some cases send them for the first time
        to a particular NETCONF client.  These notifications are sent
        the same way as normal notifications.
      </p>

      <p>
        The NetconfSession class provides a few methods for the notifications:
	<dl termtype="em">
	  <dt>createSubscription()</dt>
	  <dd> 
	    creates a subscription to the standard NETCONF stream.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>createSubscription(String streamName)</dt>
	  <dd>
	    creates a subscription to the given streamName.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>createSubscription(String streamName, NodeSet|String eventFilter,String startTime, String stopTime)</dt>
	  <dd>creates a subscription to the given streamName, an eventFilter is provided to filter 
	    events on the server side, and a startTime and stopTime is used for replaying old events 
	    from the event log.
	    <dl termtype="em">
	      <dt>eventFilter</dt>
	      <dd>
		indicates which subset of
		all possible events is of interest.  This is either a subtree
		filter, or an XPath string expression 
		(then the server needs to suport the :xpath capability).
		If not present, all events not
		precluded by other parameters will be sent.
	      </dd>
	      <dt>startTime</dt>
	      <dd>
		triggers the replay feature
		and indicate that the replay should start at the time
		specified.  If startTime is not present, 
		this is not a replay subscription.  
		It is not valid to specify start times that are
		later than the current time.  If the startTime specified is
		earlier than the log can support, the replay will begin with
		the earliest available notification.
		This parameter is of type dateTime.		  
	      </dd>
	      <dt>stopTime</dt>
	      <dd>
		is used with the optional replay feature to 
		indicate the newest notifications of
		interest.  If stop time is not present, the notifications will
		continue until the subscription is terminated.  Must be used
		with and be later than startTime.  Values of stopTime in
		the future are valid.  This parameter is of type dateTime.
	      </dd>	      
	    </dl>
	  </dd>
	  <dt>getStreams()</dt> 
	  <dd> 
	    returns the available streams.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>receiveNotification()</dt>
	  <dd>
	    performs a blocking read. 
	    This method will return the received notification.
	  </dd>
	</dl>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Here's an example of how the NETCONF notifications class can be used.
	A subscription is made and the thread will do a blocking read 
	with the <c>receiveNotification()</c> method.
      </p>

    <title>Replay Feature</title>
    <body>        
      <p>
	A replay of notifications is specified by including the optional
	startTime parameter to the subscription command, which indicates
	the start time of the replay.  The end time is specified using the
	optional stopTime parameter.  If not present, notifications will
	continue to be sent until the subscription is terminated.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	A notification stream that supports replay is not expected to have an
	unlimited supply of saved notifications available to accommodate any
	replay request.
      </p>
      
      <p>
	The actual number of stored notifications available for retrieval at
	any given time is a NETCONF server implementation specific matter.
	Control parameters for this aspect of the feature are outside the
	scope of this document.

    <title>Interleave Capability</title>
    <body>        
      <p>
	Theres an Interleave capability that 
	indicates that the NETCONF peer supports the ability to interleave 
	other NETCONF operations within a Notification subscription.
	This means the NETCONF server must receive, process and respond 
	to NETCONF requests on a session with an active notification subscription.
