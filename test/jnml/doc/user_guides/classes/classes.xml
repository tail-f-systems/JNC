  <title>An Overview of the INM Classes</title>
  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The purpose of INM is to provide functionality to make it easy
        to manage configuration and operational elements on a NETCONF enabled
        device. The main classes <em>Element</em> and
        <em>NetconfSession</em> are described in separate chapters.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        All INM classes are briefly introduced in the following
        sub-sections. For implementation details please refer to the
        Javadoc API documentation.
      </p>

  <section>
    <title>The Element Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>Element</em> class is used to represent a simplified
        Document Object Model (DOM) tree of configuration
        elements. For example <em>NetconfSession.get</em> and
        <em>NetconfSession.getConfig</em> can be used to extract the
        configuration from a NETCONF device as an Element object.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        There are many methods in this class with the sole purpose to
        make it easy to create and manipulate element hierarchies.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        An Element class can also be used to represent a subtree
        filter which is a standard filtering mechanism in NETCONF. 
      </p>

      <p>
        An Element object always belongs to a namespace and has a
        name, a set of attributes, an optional value, and an optional set
        of Element children. Element also have a pointer to its
        parent Element object (to make it easy to traverse the
        tree). Element furthermore has a <em>PrefixMap</em> mapping
        namespace URIs to XML prefixes.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>The NetconfSession Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>NetconfSession</em> class is the logical connection
        between a network administrator or network configuration
        application and a network device. A device must support at
        least one NETCONF session and should support multiple
        sessions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A NETCONF session towards a device is established by 
        the NetconfSession constructor which takes a
        <em>Transport</em> object as an argument. The Transport is
        responsible for the underlying transport mechanism.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Additional Transport classes can easily be realised as
        custom implementations of the Transport interface.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        NETCONF operations are handled by the session using an RPC
        mechanism. It is possible to extend this class to make
        implementations of proprietary capabilities. The
        <em>ConfDSession</em> class is an example of such an
        extension.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>The ConfDSession Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>ConfDSession</em> class extends the NetconfSession
        class and provides custom ConfD capabilities such as
        <em>:transactions</em> and <em>:with-defaults</em>. Read more
        about this topic in the ConfD User Guide.
      </p>

  <section>
    <title>The SSHTransport Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>SSHTransport</em> class implements the Transport
        interface and provides a SSH transport based on the Java2
        Ganymed SSH implementation.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>The TCPTransport Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>TCPTransport</em> class implements the Transport
        interface and provides a clear-text TCP transport. This is a
        proprietary ConfD class and can only be used to connect to
        a ConfD NETCONF server.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The Attribute Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>Attribute</em> class represents an attribute attached to an Element. An attribute must have a name and a
        value.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The Prefix Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>Prefix</em> class is a sub-class of the
        <em>Attribute</em> class and results in an XML specific
        <em>xmlns</em> attribute when it reaches the NETCONF device
        such as <c>&lt;bar
        xmlns:foo="http://example.com/foo/1.0"&gt;</c>.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The PrefixMap Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>PrefixMap</em> represents a list of prefix
        mappings. It is an <em>ArrayList</em> of
        Prefix objects. An Element has a <em>PrefixMap</em>
        which is used to find the namespace of any given prefix.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The NodeSet Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
	Many of the methods in the library returns a set of Element
	objects. A <em>NodeSet</em> is an <em>ArrayList</em> of
	Element objects.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The Path Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>Path</em> class makes it possible to select elements
        from a configuration tree, i.e. an Element tree. A Path
        represents a small subset of the W3C XPATH 1.0
        recommendation. For example:
        <em>hosts/host[name="john"]</em> is a path expression 
        which selects all host elements with the name 'john'.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The PathCreate Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>PathCreate</em> class makes it possible to create
	a complete Element tree in a single operation. It is related to
        the Path class but the path is used for Element tree creation
        rather than selection.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <title>The XMLParser Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        The <em>XMLParser</em> class is an XML parser that builds
	Element trees from string oriented XML.
      </p>
    </body>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>The NMLException Class</title>
    <body>
      <p>
        Whenever an error occurs the INM library throws an instance
        of this class.
