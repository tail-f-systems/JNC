This User Guide describes the JNC configuration management library. It provides an overview of
the architecture of the library, its APIs including usage examples, and guidelines on how to extend
the feature set.

JNC also comes with a detailed API specification in Javadoc format.

This guide is designed for developers who are planning to use the library. To use this document, you will
need a broad understanding of the Java programming language, XML, YANG, and the NETCONF
protocol.

The examples in this guide requires access to a standards based NETCONF server. If we communicate
with a NETCONF server with YANG support, we can utilize the data model at the server and compile a set of
Java classes explicitly for the data model at the managed device, otherwise we must revert to a lower lever API that is
not aware of the data model at the managed device.
