                         JNC Introductory Example
                         ==========================

1. Purpose
==========

This example demonstrates a simple application using JNC to manage a NETCONF
capable device.

2. Topology
===========

This example uses two nodes as follows:

  * Our JNC application.

  * A NETCONF capable device, in this particular example, we assume that
    Tail-f ConfD is used, but in fact any NETCONF enabled device would do.

For the sake of simplicity, the following simplification has been made:

Both nodes run on the same computer and communicates over the loopback
interface (i.e. remote host is set to "localhost" on both nodes). In a real
life situation, they would normally run on different computers. If your ConfD
node runs on a different machine than JNC, there are a couple of additional
steps to take, please see section 5 below.

3. Prerequisites
================

In order to run this demonstration, you need the following:

  * One computer with Linux operating system installed.
  * ConfD version 5.2 or later.
  * JNC.
  * Tools to build C programs, e.g. gcc, make.
  * Java version 1.4 or later.
  * ant program.

4. Building and Running the JNC Introductory Example
======================================================

4.1 Building and Starting ConfD
===============================

Open a shell and set your current working directory to the directory where
your installation of ConfD resides:

  # cd <your confd installation dir>

Source the rc script in the ConfD root directory:

  # source <confd_dir>/confdrc

        or if you are using the tcsh:

  # source <confd_dir>/confdrc.tcsh

Then change directory

  # cd <YOUR JNC DIR>/examples/0-intro

Build the ConfD node and start it:

  # make clean all start

4.2 Building JNC example
========================

Follow the instructions in the <YOUR JNC DIR>/README to build JNC.

Set your current working directory to the directory where
this JNC example resides:

  # cd <YOUR JNC DIR>/examples/0-intro

Build the JNC example:

  # gradle clean build

4.3 Run the Example
===============================

Run this example by doing:

  # gradle run

4.4 Stopping ConfD
===============================

After completing the examples above, stop ConfD as follows:

  # make stop

5. ConfD and JNC on different hosts
=====================================

You can also run the example above having ConfD and JNC on separate
machines. If so, the following additional steps has to be made:
This is the required procedure for users using the win32 version of
JNC.

5.1 Building and Starting ConfD
===============================

On the machine where ConfD is installed, execute the steps above
that start ConfD

On the machine where JNC runs, execute the ant script.

5.2. Building and Running the JNC examples
===========================================

The JNC example assumes that the ConfD server is running on the same
machine. Edit the file src/app/Main.java as follows

There are two occurences of the following line:

  dev = new Device("mydev", duser, "localhost", 2022);


Replace the string "localhost" with the IP address or host name of your ConfD
server, e.g.:

  dev = new Device("mydev", duser, "mydevice", 2022);

or

  dev = new Device("mydev", duser, "192.168.1.1", 2022);

Then rebuild.
